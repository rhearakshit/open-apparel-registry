# Contributing to the Open Apparel Registry

Thanks so much for your interest in contributing to the Open Apparel Registry (OAR)! ✨ We're exctited you're here.

A quick refresher: The OAR is designed to be an open, crowdsourced database of apparel factories around the world, which normalizes information - i.e. factory names and locations - across multiple, disparate data sources.

This document is a set of guidelines to set you up to contribute towards this project. Since what we're primarily looking for at the moment is feedback on the initial designs and prototypes of the OAR platform, you will be requested to contribute using platforms and tools outside of Github.
