<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Welcome to the Open Apparel Registry! ðŸŒŽðŸ‘•ðŸŽ‰</h3>

The Open Apparel Registry (OAR) is designed to be an <b>open, crowdsourced database</b> of apparel factories around the world, and it does this by normalizing information - i.e. factory names and locations - across data sources.
