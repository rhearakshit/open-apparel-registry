<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Welcome to the Open Apparel Registry! 🌎👕🎉</h3>

The Open Apparel Registry (OAR) is designed to be an <b>open, crowdsourced database</b> of apparel factories around the world, and it does this by normalizing information - i.e. factory names and locations - across data sources.

The OAR is a collaborative project between [Sourcemap](sourcemap.com) and the [C&A Foundation](candafoundation.org), and is currently in its discovery and prototyping phase. The OAR is inviting industry stakeholders - from factories and brands, to researchers and civil society organizations - to sign up to participate in our design research and focus group discussions, and for user testing in our beta launch this summer.
