<h1>Open Apparel Registry</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Open Apparel Registry! 🌎👕🎉</h2>

The [Open Apparel Registry](https://openapprel.org) is designed to be an <b>open, crowdsourced database</b> of apparel factories around the world, and it does this by normalizing information - i.e. factory names and locations - across data sources.

<h2>About</h2>

<h3>The Problem 📋🗄📋</h3> 

<b>Did you know that the fashion industry is the second largest polluter of water 💦, or that garment workers in many of the world's largest garment producing regions like Bangladesh and Cambodia, frequently earn well below a living wage? 💰</b>

<br>

The good news is that we are definitely at an inflection point in in the apparel industry when it comes to sustainability - there has been a dramatic increase in the amount and type of data collected and disclosed on the location and performance of garment producing factories, by different kinds of industry stakeholders - including universities, NGOs, auditing firms, governments, certification bodies and brands. 

<br>

Yet all of this data is stored in separate databases, where the names and addresses of factories can be saved in dozens of different ways. <b>As a result, anyone interested in finding out more about the ethical practices or environmental performance of a brand and its supply chain, needs to engage in laborious and time-consuming research to match the factory names and addresses used by each of the abovementioned stakeholders to each other. </b> 

<br>

Based on conversations with leading brands and NGOs in the apparel sector, it is estimated that each major stakeholder spends anywhere between €50-100k per year on this effort alone (!), which is usually totally out of reach for smaller organizations or individuals.

<h3>The Solution 📋↔️📋</h3> 

<b>The Open Apparel Registry (OAR) solves this problem through an open database and a sophisticated name-and-address matching algorithm that eliminates the need for each stakeholder to carry out the manual work of matching across databases. </b>

In simple speak - the OAR will act as a central list of factory names and locations that anyone can use to normalize names and addresses. It will function as a free, open data repository that can be used directly via an online interface, or indirectly via a real-time open API (think a ‘Google Places’ like service customized for the needs of the apparel and footwear sector). The OAR will centralize data - specifically factory names and addresses - that are submitted by various contributors, including brands, industry associations and non-profits (among others). Data contributors will be listed alongside the factories they have submitted to both increase their visibility, as well as encourage greater transparency. To contribute to the database, users will be required to create an account with the OAR; however there are no restrictions on who is able to sign up and contribute. Users that are only interested in browsing the online map will be able access it freely. 


<h2>The Collaborators 🎈</h2>
The OAR is a collaborative project between <b>Sourcemap</b> (https://sourcemap.com), a technology company focused on developing end to end supply chain mapping software, and the <b>C&A Foundation</b> (http://www.candafoundation.org/), an organization that brings together brands, initiatives and people to collectively create a more fair and sustainable fashion industry.

<h2>How You Can Help 💬</h2> 

As the OAR is currently in its discovery and prototyping phase, we are reaching out to different types of industry stakeholders - from factories and brands, to researchers and civil society organizations - to participate in our user research and focus group discussions to better inform the OAR's design.

<b>With the first set of designs now available for initial user feedback and testing, the OAR team is excited to invite design feedback, specifically focused on UX, UI and Content, from anyone interested in contributing their time to this project. Designs will be shared using an InVision link, through which you will be able to provide feedback either directly using InVision's Comments feature, or through a standard Google Docs template. </b>
