<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Welcome to the Open Apparel Registry! 🌎👕🎉</h3>

The Open Apparel Registry (OAR) is designed to be an <b>open, crowdsourced database</b> of apparel factories around the world, and it does this by normalizing information - i.e. factory names and locations - across data sources.

<h3>The Problem 📋🗄📋</h3> 

<b>Did you know that the fashion industry is the second largest polluter of water 💦, or that garment workers in many of the world's largest garment producing regions like Bangladesh and Cambodia, frequently earn well below a living wage? 💰</b>

<br>

The good news is that we are definitely at an inflection point in in the apparel industry when it comes to sustainability - there has been a dramatic increase in the amount and type of data collected and disclosed on the location and performance of garment producing factories, by different kinds of industry stakeholders - including universities, NGOs, auditing firms, governments, certification bodies and brands. 

<br>

Yet all of this data is stored in separate databases, where the names and addresses of factories can be saved in dozens of different ways. <b>As a result, anyone seeking to assess the performance of a brand and its supply chain needs to engage in laborious and time-consuming research to match the factory names and addresses used by each stakeholder group involved. </b> 
Based on conversations with leading brands and NGOs in the apparel sector, it is estimated that each major stakeholder spends anywhere between €50-100k per year on this effort alone, which is invariably totally out of reach for smaller organizations.

<h3>The Solution 📋↔️📋</h3> 
<b>The Open Apparel Registry solves this industry-wide problem through an open database and a sophisticated name-and-address matching algorithm that eliminates the need for each stakeholder to carry out the manual work of matching across databases.</b>


The OAR will act as a central list of factory names and locations that anyone can use to normalize names and addresses. It will function as a free, open data repository that can be used directly via an intuitive online interface, or indirectly via a real-time open API, akin to a ‘Google Places’ service customized for the needs of the apparel and footwear sector. The OAR will centralize data that is scraped from the brand's public factory lists and organizational databases of factory IDs and addresses. Data contributors will be listed alongside the factories they have identified to increase their visibility.

<h3>The Collaborators 🎈</h3>
The OAR is a collaborative project between [Sourcemap](https://sourcemap.com), a technology company focused on developing end to end supply chain mapping software 🗺, and the [C&A Foundation](candafoundation.org), an organization that brings together brands, initiatives and people to collectively create a more fair and sustainable fashion industry ⚖️.

<h3>How You Can Help 💬</h3> 
As the OAR is currently in its discovery and prototyping phase, we are reaching out to all kinds of industry stakeholders - from factories and brands, to researchers and civil society organizations - to sign up to participate in our user research and focus group discussions to better inform the OAR's design. We are also inviting interested users to sign up as beta testers for the OAR's beta launch scheduled for Summer 2018.
