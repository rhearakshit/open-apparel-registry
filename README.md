<h2>About the Open Apparel Registry</h2>
The Open Apparel Registry (OAR) is a global map of apparel factories. 
It is designed to be an open, crowdsourced database of apparel factories around the world, and it does this by normalizing information - i.e. factory names and locations - across data sources.
